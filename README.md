# Predicting Airline Seat Occupancy in Turkey

## Motivation

Air travel demand fluctuates due to various factors, including economic conditions, seasonal trends, holidays, and unexpected events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding these patterns is essential for airlines to optimize pricing strategies, allocate resources efficiently, and enhance customer experience. This project aims to analyze historical flight occupancy rates in Turkey and develop predictive models to forecast future occupancy trends. By integrating economic indicators, fuel prices, holidays, and external disruptions, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into passenger load factors and their determining factors.

## Objectives:

Analyze Historical Flight Occupancy Trends: Examine past flight occupancy rates in Turkey to identify patterns and fluctuations over time.​

Assess the Impact of Economic Indicators: Evaluate how factors such as fuel prices, inflation rates, and currency exchange fluctuations influence air travel demand and seat occupancy.​

Evaluate the Effects of External Disruptions: Investigate the impact of events like the COVID-19 pandemic on passenger load factors and identify any lasting effects on travel behavior.​

Develop Predictive Models: Create machine learning models that forecast future flight occupancy rates based on historical data and identified influencing factors.​

Provide Strategic Insights: Offer actionable recommendations for airlines to optimize pricing strategies, resource allocation, and customer experience based on predictive insights.​


## Data Source

The data for this project will be collected from multiple sources to ensure comprehensive analysis:

- **Turkish Airlines & DHMI Reports**: Official reports detailing monthly passenger statistics, seat capacity, and flight occupancy rates.
- **Google Flights / Skyscanner API**: Real-time data on available seats and ticket pricing trends.
- **Economic Indicators**: Data on fuel prices, inflation rates, and currency exchange fluctuations that may impact travel demand.
- **COVID-19 Impact Data**: Historical restrictions on air travel and their effect on passenger load factors.
- **Holiday & Seasonal Data**: Public holiday schedules and peak travel periods influencing occupancy rates.

## Data Analysis

The project will involve multiple stages of data processing and analysis:

- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Integrating multiple data sources, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends in flight occupancy over different time periods, visualizing demand fluctuations, and determining correlations between variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from raw data, including economic indices, airline-specific factors, and external influences like weather or fuel costs.

## Findings

The project aims to answer the following key questions:

- How do seasonal patterns and public holidays affect flight occupancy rates?
- What is the correlation between economic conditions (inflation, fuel prices, exchange rates) and airline seat utilization?
- How did the COVID-19 pandemic impact airline occupancy, and are there lingering effects in post-pandemic travel trends?
- Can machine learning models accurately predict future flight occupancy based on past trends and external factors?
- How can airlines leverage these predictive insights to enhance pricing strategies, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall customer satisfaction?

## Limitations and Future Work

While this project seeks to provide meaningful insights, certain limitations must be acknowledged:

- **Data Availability**: Some airline-specific data may not be publicly accessible, requiring estimation techniques or alternative data sources.
- **External Factors**: Unexpected events (geopolitical crises, new travel restrictions) may impact airline occupancy in ways that are difficult to model.
- **Model Accuracy**: While machine learning models can make predictions, they rely on the quality and completeness of historical data.

For future improvements, additional data sources such as real-time social media sentiment analysis or customer booking patterns could enhance prediction accuracy.
